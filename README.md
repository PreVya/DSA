1. Enter the directory of your choice (Ssy Stack)<br>
Cmd: cd Stack<br>

2. The nomenclature is always  |DSname||nthprogram||about program| Ex: For stack program demonstation infix to postfix notion the name of program is stack4infixtopostfix.cpp Thus here DSname is stack, 4 is the occuraence and since program is for converting infix expression to postfix, at last infixtopostfix is written in name.<br>

3. To execure the program:<br>
Cmd: a. g++ -o |executable file name| |name of cpp file|<br>
      b. ./ |executable file name | <br>
   Ex: g++ -o stack4 stack4infixtopostfix.cpp<br>
   ./stack4<br>

DS covered are:
1. Array / Array ADT
2. Matrices
3. Recursion (Not a data structure but imortant concept in DS)
4. String
5. LinkedList (Simple, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, Doubly Circular Lined List)
6. Stack
